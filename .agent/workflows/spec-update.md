Please incorporate the changes you have made into the specifications (.agent\specs\*.md) following the steps below.
Repeat this process 10 times. Think deeply about and confirm that each step is written logically and comprehensively.
1. Examine and extract all changes.
2. Incorporate the implementation into the specifications.
3. Examine the specifications thoroughly and compare them with the current implementation.
4. Feedback the specifications.
5. Start again from step 1.

Please be sure to follow all of the following steps.
- All text and wording must be written in Japanese.
- Duplicate specifications are prohibited. Specifications should be defined in one document and one location. If similar explanations are needed in other specifications or documents, please refer to that single location.
- Destroying templates is prohibited. If the chapter structure, etc., deviates from the template, please modify the template and apply it to other documents too.
- When creating or changing chapter structure or document structure, please consider scalability.
- State only facts (currently implemented specifications); do not include speculations or requests.
- If, after comparing the specifications and implementation, you discover inconsistencies between the specifications and implementation, contradictions between specifications, insufficient implementation, or suggestions, please create a dedicated document for "Implementation Report Inconsistencies" and report them.
- Instead of rewriting all the data, please make differential changes to the existing content.
