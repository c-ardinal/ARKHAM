description: RequirementSpecification update
---

Please incorporate the changes you have made into the specifications (RequirementSpecification.json and RequirementSpecification_Image_Graph.md) following the steps below.
Repeat this process 10 times. Think deeply about and confirm that each step is written logically and comprehensively.
1. Examine and extract all changes.
2. Incorporate the implementation into the specifications.
3. Examine the specifications thoroughly and compare them with the current implementation.
4. Feedback the specifications.
5. Start again from step 1.

Please be sure to adhere to all of the following:
- Label names can be written in English, but all other text and wording must be written in Japanese.
- Data duplication is prohibited. Define data in a single location and refer to that single location whenever similar descriptions are needed.
- Destroying existing data structures is generally prohibited.
- Consider scalability when creating or modifying data structures.
- Use consistent keys for blocks and lists at the same level. If there is nothing to write, write "".
- Write only facts (currently implemented specifications), do not write speculations or requests.
- If, after comparing the specifications and implementation and thinking carefully, you find any inconsistencies between the specifications and implementation, contradictions between the specifications, insufficient implementation, or suggestions, write them in "implementation_report_inconsistencies".
- Rather than rewriting all the data, make differential changes to the existing description.
